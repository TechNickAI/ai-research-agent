# AI Research Agent

## Overview

The Advanced AI Research Assistant is a sophisticated tool designed to transcend the limitations of current AI assistants. By incorporating advanced methodologies like chain of thought reasoning, self-reflection mechanisms, and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach, this assistant is capable of complex autonomous tasks with high efficiency and accuracy.

## Features

- **Chain of Thought Reasoning**: Enhances task completion efficiency by generating structured plans before execution.
- **Self-Reflection Mechanism**: Boosts performance by allowing the AI to review and correct its initial responses.
- **Tool Integration**: Utilizes tools such as Open Interpreter to execute Python code and terminal commands, expanding functionality.
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Approach**: Mimics human iterative problem-solving by revisiting and correcting previous steps dynamically.
- **Iterative Code Improvement**: Develops a self-sustaining environment for continuous improvement through bug detection, submission, and fixing.
